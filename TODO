Backend:
  Routes:
    ☐ Ensure every route returns JSON if server processed request
      No timeouts, no any non-json content types, no native 500 errors when something fails
    ☐ Add testing routes group if in `test` environment
      ☐ Route that simply throws an error
    ☐ Handle uncaught exceptions for routes
    ☐ Provide all routes with dummy in-memory data and ensure they passing tests
      imitate mongo with default variables
    ☐ Connect routes to mongo 1 by 1 and check it to suite tests
  Logging:
    ☐ Progressive logger (bunyan, winston, etc.)
    ☐ Tune logging levels and streams:
      test/prod: only to file
      dev: to file and console both + file carousele
